      "james_vaccaro": {"title":"James Vaccaro (1913–1985)","photo":"","text":"James was born in Pennsylvania and grew up during hard times. He moved around, worked with his hands, and kept the family steady through war-time shortages and the slow rebuild afterward. In Ohio he became known for a steady work ethic — tending property, showing up early, and never shirking a responsibility. Later he moved west and lived out his years in California. Family stories remember him as quiet but strong: the person who fixed a broken truck at midnight or who could coax a stubborn mule with a look. I grew up on these stories like lullabies; even if I never met him, I feel his presence whenever someone in our family chooses care over convenience."},
      "rose_kirila": {"title":"Rose Louise Kirila","photo":"","text":"Rose was the bridge between Hungary and Ohio. She kept household rituals alive: festival foods, particular prayers, and a stubborn garden that fed a family through tight seasons. She could read the weather in the sky and the teeth of a plow. Everyone remembers her kitchen as the place where stories became recipes and where children learned to sit quietly while she kneaded dough and told a story about the old country. When I close my eyes I almost smell the dough she used to make — heavy and warm — and imagine the way she taught patience by turning flour into a meal."},
      "deborah": {"title":"Deborah (née Vaccaro) Patton (b. 1959)","photo":"","text":"Deborah’s childhood was threaded by the rhythms of Ohio farming life and Hungarian customs. She remembers waking before dawn to help with chores, the feel of cold soil, and neighbors who shared both work and stories. Later she moved west and married Gary, bringing the old recipes and a quiet, organizing strength to a new household. Deborah’s presence is remembered in the small domestic details — a carefully folded napkin, a meal that can soothe, and the way she keeps family birthdays on a calendar in her head. To me, Deborah is the person who holds a family’s emotional map; she remembers who needs a call and who needs soup when things go wrong."},
      "william_patton": {"title":"William Patton","photo":"","text":"William carried Northern Ireland with him in the way he spoke about saints, the cadence of old sermons, and the quiet manner he brought into noisy American rooms. He raised his children with clear rules and a wry sense of humor that showed up at table. Family lore credits him for teaching patience — the value of waiting and working — and for passing down small talismans, like a worn pocket prayer-book or a chipped china cup, that became family heirlooms. I picture William in the evenings, hands folded, telling a story that made everyone quiet — not because he needed silence, but because his words deserved to be heard."},
      "beatrice_fisher": {"title":"Beatrice Fisher (Crozier connection)","photo":"","text":"Beatrice’s memory is a tapestry of faith, resilience, and a practical tenderness. The Crozier line shows up in old photographs: crisp collars, careful hair, and that quiet pride in being able to make a home out of scarce things. Beatrice taught younger family members how to keep a house that smelled welcome and how to read a recipe as a kind of language worth preserving. As I tell the story, she is the keeper of small rituals that ripple across generations: a tea set, a folded letter, a recipe scrawled on the back of an envelope."},
      "lynne": {"title":"Lynne Patton","photo":"","text":"Lynne is remembered as a steady presence in the Patton family — the aunt who attended every school event and who kept long-running joke threads alive at family parties. Though records are thin, the stories that survive paint her as warm, practical, and the kind of person who could organize a reunion with calm efficiency. In the stories I tell children now, Lynne is the one who shows up with extra chairs and a weary smile; she makes the mechanics of family look easy when they’re anything but."},
      "gary": {"title":"Gary Patton (b. 1956)","photo":"","text":"Gary was born in Belfast into a household where religion and ritual structured daily life. He later moved to California and, like many immigrants, learned to translate old habits into new rhythms. Gary married Deborah in 1984 and built a family that balanced strict expectations with a deep loyalty. He tells stories about Ireland — about fields, stubborn weather, and the odd comfort of a well-steeped cup of tea — and his children remember him as a man who blended sternness with sudden, small acts of generosity: a fixed bike, an unexpected cake, a private grin at a family joke. To us he is both disciplinarian and soft-hearted keeper of tales."},
      "daniel": {"title":"Daniel Patton (b. 1992)","photo":"","text":"Daniel grew up in Woodland Hills and represents a generational shift: more rooted in California life than in the old stories, but still attentive to them. Friends remember him as easygoing, quick with a grin, and practical: the person who can turn a spare part into a working lamp and who still shows up for family dinners when they matter most. I like telling the younger ones about Daniel as the cousin who can make things work; his calm competence is a kind of inherited gift."},
      "shannen": {"title":"Shannen Patton (b. 1987)","photo":"","text":"Born in Woodland Hills, Shannen grew up balancing Patton tradition and the pull of California life. She cherishes small rituals: family recipes from Ohio, holiday gatherings, and the habit of calling relatives on birthdays. Married to Brian, she keeps the household running and the family calendar full. In my memory she is the silent engine — the one who remembers the plates, the songs, and the jokes that make us all feel like we belong."},
      "brian": {"title":"Brian Kupfer (b. 1981)","photo":"","text":"Brian is the kind of practical teacher people remember — patient when explaining a difficult technique, quick to laugh when something goes wrong, and serious when it comes to his responsibilities. He trained people in trades, worked in plastic tooling for Lockheed, and even coached in Ireland for a spell. He married Shannen in 2020 and speaks fondly of ordinary domestic moments: a Saturday project in the garage, late-night pancakes, and quiet conversations about the future. People describe him as reliable and unexpectedly tender. He is the kind of man who builds family not with grand speeches but with steady hands and late-night jokes."},
      "breanna": {"title":"Breanna Kupfer (b. 2021)","photo":"","text":"Breanna arrived to a household full of laughter and careful routines.

      "robert_kupfer": {"title":"Robert Kupfer","photo":"","text":"Robert is the elder presence of the Kupfer side: a man who kept family links strong through phone calls, weekend gatherings, and quiet support. Workmanlike and direct, he valued steady employment and was proud when his children learned a trade. He taught that dignity is often practical: a steady job, a reliable handshake, and a family calendar that never loses a birthday."},
      "patricia_kupfer": {"title":"Patricia Kupfer","photo":"","text":"Patricia held the family together with small rituals: a shared holiday table, a tidy guest room, a telephone always ready for a check-in. She is remembered for practical kindness. She made the house a harbor — clothes folded, a kettle simmering, and a willingness to receive whoever turned up at the door."},
      "cort": {"title":"Cort Kupfer","photo":"","text":"Cort is known in family circles as someone who carries on the humor and directness of his parents.

      "jonathan": {"title":"Jonathan Kupfer","photo":"","text":"Jonathan is a quieter member of the extended group — a step-uncle who keeps in touch and turns up to help when family plans require extra hands. His presence is often understated, but folks notice when he’s not around because he’s the one who quietly made sure something got done."},
      "nannete": {"title":"Nannete Dean","photo":"","text":"Nannete was raised partly in France and brought a worldly patience to family life. She is remembered for quiet generosity and for recipes that recall markets and fig trees. Her culinary stories always hinted at wider worlds — the comfort of a good stew and the warmth of a hand-knitted scarf. I remember thinking she made us feel cosmopolitan without leaving town."},
      "mario": {"title":"Mario Dean (1985–2014)","photo":"","text":"Mario’s life was short and intense — a figure who appears in family memory as both vulnerable and vivid. He died in 2014 but left behind stories and jokes that still surface at gatherings. People speak of Mario with affection and an ache; he was someone who lived loudly and left behind echoes that remind us to hold one another close."},

He’s described as serious, capable, and private about his struggles. The family story about Renato is one of steady, careful competence — someone who takes vows seriously and brings that seriousness home."},
      "demarco": {"title":"Demarco Victoria","photo":"","text":"Demarco and his three children are part of the wider Dean network. Family memory locates them among the many small, ordinary stories of everyday care.

      "gino": {"title":"Gino Dean","photo":"","text":"Gino lives in San Diego and is described as friendly and practical.

      "demetri": {"title":"Demetri Dean","photo":"","text":"Possibly a cousin — Demetri appears in family memory as someone who kept to himself but who mattered in small ways. People remember him for quiet acts: showing up, carrying groceries, being a steady neighbor when it mattered."},
      "eugene": {"title":"Eugene Edward Kirili (1936–1994)","photo":"","text":"Eugene’s life traces a path across Ohio and Pennsylvania.

      "ruth_barris": {"title":"Ruth Adaline Barris (b. 1939)","photo":"","text":"Ruth’s life is traced through small community ties — church groups, midday phone calls, and neighborly breakfasts. She and Eugene raised at least one daughter and kept close to the rhythms of Trumbull and West Middlesex. Her manner was kindly and neighborly; she smoothed edges and kept the family in contact."},
      "fisher_note": {"title":"Fisher / Crozier / Fischer notes","photo":"","text":"Some family lines use Fisher, some Fischer, and a Crozier appears in marriage records and oral recollections. These name-variants point to likely migrations and the way records sometimes split families across different spellings. In practical terms, it means our paper trail sometimes plays tricks on us — but the stories remain steady."},
      "michael": {"title":"Michael Dean (You)","photo":"","text":"Michael Dean — born December 10, 2008. The only one in the family with an Italian thread in name and story, Michael carries family traditions forward while making his own path. He remembers holidays, small pranks, and long car rides; he’s curious about family history and keeps a soft spot for the old recipes and the stories that are told around the table. If our family is a book, Michael is the next chapter, curious and hopeful and ready to write his own lines."}
