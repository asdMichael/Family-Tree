const bios = {
  "james_vaccaro": {"title":"James Vaccaro (1913–1985)","text":"James was born in Pennsylvania and grew up during hard times. He moved around, worked with his hands, and kept the family steady through war-time shortages and the slow rebuild afterward. In Ohio he became known for a steady work ethic — tending property, showing up early, and never shirking a responsibility. Later he moved west and lived out his years in California. Family stories remember him as quiet but strong: the person who fixed a broken truck at midnight or who could coax a stubborn mule with a look. Growing up, we would say, 'Do it like James' — a small reminder of steadiness and care."},
  "rose_kirila": {"title":"Rose Louise Kirila","text":"Rose was the bridge between Hungary and Ohio. She kept household rituals alive: festival foods, particular prayers, and a stubborn garden that fed a family through tight seasons. She could read the weather in the sky and the teeth of a plow. Everyone remembers her kitchen as the place where stories became recipes and where children learned to sit quietly while she kneaded dough and told stories about the old country. Those recipes became our anchors."},
  "deborah": {"title":"Deborah (née Vaccaro) Patton (b. 1959)","text":"Deborah’s childhood was threaded by the rhythms of Ohio farming life and Hungarian customs. She remembers waking before dawn to help with chores, the feel of cold soil, and neighbors who shared both work and stories. Later she moved west and married Gary, bringing the old recipes and a quiet, organizing strength to a new household. Deborah’s presence is remembered in the small domestic details — a carefully folded napkin, a meal that can soothe, and the way she keeps family birthdays on a calendar in her head. She is the one we call when we need calm."},
  "william_patton": {"title":"William Patton","text":"William carried Northern Ireland with him in the way he spoke about saints, the cadence of old sermons, and the quiet manner he brought into noisy American rooms. He raised his children with clear rules and a wry sense of humor that showed up at table. Family lore credits him for teaching patience — the value of waiting and working — and for passing down small talismans, like a worn pocket prayer-book or a chipped china cup, that became family heirlooms."},
  "beatrice_fisher": {"title":"Beatrice Fisher (Crozier connection)","text":"Beatrice’s memory is a tapestry of faith, resilience, and a practical tenderness. The Crozier line shows up in old photographs: crisp collars, careful hair, and that quiet pride in being able to make a home out of scarce things. Beatrice taught younger family members how to keep a house that smelled welcome and how to read a recipe as a kind of language worth preserving."},
  "demarco": {"title":"Demarco Victoria","text":"Demarco was the steady branch that grew into our Dean line. Practical, hands-on, and the kind of person who made sure the family affairs were in order, his story threads through weekends of labor, shared jokes, and small practical lessons that the kids learned in the garage and at the dining table."},
  "giana": {"title":"Giana Dean","text":"Giana’s death by suicide is a deep wound in the family. Remembered with tenderness, her life prompts quiet conversations about mental health and care. We tell her story so that we might learn to hold one another more gently; her memory asks us to listen and to reach out."},
  "gary": {"title":"Gary Patton (b. 1956)","text":"Gary was born in Belfast into a household where religion and ritual structured daily life. He later moved to California and learned to translate old habits into new rhythms. He tells stories about Ireland — fields, stubborn weather, and the odd comfort of a well-steeped cup of tea. He built a family that balanced stern rules with sudden small acts of generosity, like fixing a bike or baking an unexpected cake."},
  "lynne": {"title":"Lynne Patton","text":"Lynne is remembered as a warm, organizing presence — the aunt who attended school events, kept family jokes alive, and always had an extra chair. Her steady involvement kept reunions smooth and memories connected."},
  "robert_kupfer": {"title":"Robert Kupfer","text":"Robert is the elder presence of the Kupfer side: a man who kept family links strong through phone calls, weekend gatherings, and quiet support. Workmanlike and direct, he valued steady employment and was proud when his children learned a trade."},
  "patricia_kupfer": {"title":"Patricia Kupfer","text":"Patricia held the family together with small rituals: a shared holiday table, a tidy guest room, and a telephone always ready for a check-in. She is remembered for practical kindness."},
  "eugene": {"title":"Eugene Edward Kirili (1936–1994)","text":"Eugene’s life traces a path across Ohio and Pennsylvania. He is a distant great-uncle in our tree — someone who anchors stories of place and memory beyond our immediate line."},
  "ruth_barris": {"title":"Ruth Adaline Barris (b. 1939)","text":"Ruth’s life is traced through small community ties — church groups, midday phone calls, and neighborly breakfasts. She and Eugene kept close to rhythms of small towns; their branch remains an extended part of our story."},
  "mario": {"title":"Mario Dean (1985–2014)","text":"Mario’s life was short and intense — a figure who appears in family memory as both vulnerable and vivid. He died in 2014 but left behind stories and jokes that still surface at gatherings. People speak of Mario with affection and an ache; he was someone who lived loudly and left behind echoes that remind us to hold one another close."},
  "carlo": {"title":"Carlo Dean","text":"Carlo’s story includes both complications and fierce family loyalty. He’s had legal troubles and been in and out of difficult circumstances, but also shows moments of tenderness and care during better times."},
  "renato": {"title":"Renato Dean","text":"Renato served nearly a decade in the military, and that discipline shaped his approach to family and work. He’s described as serious, capable, and private about his struggles."},
  "gino": {"title":"Gino Dean","text":"Gino lives in San Diego and is described as friendly and practical. His daughter Taylor is a bright presence and family stories speak of beach days and backyard barbecues."},
  "demetri": {"title":"Demetri Dean","text":"Demetri appears in family memory as someone who kept to himself but who mattered in small ways. People remember him for quiet acts: showing up, carrying groceries, being a steady neighbor when it mattered."},
  "shannen": {"title":"Shannen Patton (b. 1987)","text":"Shannen grew up balancing Patton tradition and California life. She cherishes small rituals: family recipes from Ohio, holiday gatherings, and the habit of calling relatives on birthdays. Her life has threads across branches — earlier with Mario (Michael's father) and later with Brian (father of Breanna & Alexis). She keeps the family calendar and the meals that tie us together."},
  "brian": {"title":"Brian Kupfer (b. 1981)","text":"Brian is the kind of practical teacher people remember — patient when explaining a difficult technique, quick to laugh when something goes wrong, and serious when it comes to responsibilities. He married Shannen and together they raised Alexis and Breanna; for the family he is a builder of small routines that make a home."},
  "daniel": {"title":"Daniel Patton (b. 1992)","text":"Daniel grew up in Woodland Hills and represents a generational shift: more rooted in California life than in the old stories, but still attentive to them. Friends remember him as easygoing, practical, and the kind of person who turns a spare part into a working lamp."},
  "cort": {"title":"Cort Kupfer","text":"Cort is known in family circles as someone who carries on the humor and directness of his parents. He is practical, quick with a story, and remembers neighborhood details others forget."},
  "crystal": {"title":"Crystal Kupfer","text":"Crystal is a mother first and foremost; stories about her often center on her son Elijah and small, fiercely protective instincts. She balances warmth with a clear determination to make sure her child has what he needs."},
  "april": {"title":"April Kupfer","text":"April’s life has had complications — the strain of divorce and raising two children — but she is remembered for toughness and resourcefulness. People tell stories of her finding ways through tight times; her boys Connor and Eagan are the center of her world."},
  "everett": {"title":"Everett Kupfer","text":"Everett served in the Air Force and carried lessons of discipline into civilian life. He lives near Berkeley and is remembered for calm steadiness."},
  "jonathan": {"title":"Jonathan Kupfer","text":"Jonathan is a quieter member of the extended group — a step-uncle who keeps in touch and turns up to help when family plans require extra hands."},
  "michael": {"title":"Michael Dean (You)","text":"Michael Dean — born December 10, 2008. The only one in the family with an Italian thread in name and story, Michael carries family traditions forward while making his own path. He remembers holidays, small pranks, and long car rides; he’s curious about family history and keeps a soft spot for the old recipes and the stories that are told around the table."},
  "breanna": {"title":"Breanna Kupfer (b. 2021)","text":"Breanna arrived to a household full of laughter and careful routines. Even as a toddler she carried a clear, curious gaze and a willingness to test new textures — a trait that has everyone excited to watch her grow."},
  "alexis": {"title":"Alexis Kupfer (b. 2016)","text":"Alexis brings an early affection for storytelling and small, determined independence. From school projects to backyard games, she’s remembered as the kid who will quietly organize a group and make sure everyone has a turn."},
  "connor": {"title":"Connor (April's son)","text":"Connor is one of April’s two boys, a lively child who brings laughter and noise to family gatherings. He keeps grown-ups on their toes and the family laughing."},
  "eagan": {"title":"Eagan (April's son)","text":"Eagan is a quieter foil to his brother Connor — curious, observant, and already forming his own little rituals."},
  "elijah": {"title":"Elijah (Crystal's son)","text":"Elijah is Crystal’s pride — a young, bright child who anchors Crystal’s tenderness and fierce protection."},
  "taylor": {"title":"Taylor (Gino's daughter)","text":"Taylor is Gino’s daughter and a beach-loving kid who brings a sunlit joy to the family — days at the shore, barbecues, and an easy laugh."}
